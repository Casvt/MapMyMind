# MapMyMind
It has never been this easy to make beautiful mind maps.

Create a new map and start adding nodes. You can give them a title and optionally a body. Resize them to whichever shape you need it to be. And when you want to make a connection, it's as easy as selecting the option and clicking the two nodes to connect.

## Features

1. Unlimited amount of maps
2. Automatically saved
3. Loads of customisability
